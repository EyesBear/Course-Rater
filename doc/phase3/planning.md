 Initial Plan
In the first meeting of phase 3, we decided some additional features and UI improvement to be our goal. The final product is separated into several tasks and here is our core plan:
- Social media log in
- Enhanced search bar
	- for users who are not logged in they will have to provide the school name along with the course code for the 		search
	- for logged in users they will be asked which school they attend and allow them to only search with course codes
- Change database to adjust for addition of schools which contains courses
- Comments Section:
	- users can like or dislike a comment
	- comments are sorted by highest likes to highest dislikes
- Profile Page:
	- input the school preference
	- get name, email, and profile picture from Social Media log in
- School Page (low priority): 
	- display all courses in a school
- On rating page you will have to input teacher name too so that in display page we can display different data for different teachers
- Improve UI to add color codes for ratings, red is bad , yellow is normal, and green is good

Replanning

We decided that the admin feature may have been out of the scope of the project, and so it was only partially implmented, and omitted from the final product as a result. The feature we listed to add multiple teachers required many fundamental changes to the database, the backend, and the ratings page and was considered too much work, so we scrapped the idea.

Review & Retrospective
The plan and process of the team worked perfectly. Every team member attends the group meeting every week and contributes to the website design. We then use the plan that we came up during the meeting and made github issues where team members can keep track of the progress on the website.

Almost everything worked perfectly and was completed in time except for the responsive feature for mobile devices and the admin feature. The responsive feature and admin feature were things that we decided to add into our plan when we realized that there was not an equal amount of work for every group member, so we decided they were not important features to finish since they were optional.
  
One of the most important issues that can be improved is that we do not have enough work for every member in the group. The team brainstormed and decided to add more interesting and cool features into our website. When it came to the time where we divided up the work, there was not equal work for all six group members. In the end, we had to think of some new ideas for members to work on. However, this is not an ideal solution because it resulted in unnecessary work for some members or features that will be rarely used for the website. A potential solution is to gather feedback from other people outside the team as to what some good features may be, which would definitely help us in creating equal work for everyone.

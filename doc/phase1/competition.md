####www.ratemyprofessors.com:
#####Description:
A website which allows users to log in and give feedback on professors, as well as list the course
taken with him/her. Professors are rated by helpfulness and clarity, culminating in an overall “quality”
rating out of 5 - with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. The site allows users to search by school,
by professor, or by a combination of the two, with the option of filtering by school department.

#####How our product differs:
Our product would essentially be the opposite of this site: instead of a site dedicated to rating professors,
users would primarily rate courses while also being able to rate the associated professor should they choose
to do so. As a result, the search function of our site would require a school and a specific course, while also
allowing users to filter by department.

#####Difference in users/scenarios:
Our product would be much better for students looking to see if they should take a course or not, and students
looking to review a course they just took. The reason Rate my Professors probably didn’t focus on these users
and scenarios is to make it more clear to users that their site is intended for, as their name suggests, rating
and reviewing professors, and not necessarily courses. As it stands now, courses on their site are rated based 
on the professor who taught it, meaning course ratings don’t reflect the actual quality of the course, as ratings
differ greatly between professors. There is also no function to search by course.

#####What it would take to accommodate those users/scenarios:
In order for Rate my Professors to meet the needs of those users and scenarios, they’d need to changed their
rating system for courses, because as it stands now there is very little in the way of reflecting a course’s
quality, only the ability of the professors who teach it. Should they do this, all of their pre-existing reviews
would be useless in showing course quality, as required fields like workload, time-commitment etc do not yet
exist. They would also need to add the ability to search by course. All of this would take them a lot of time,
and would be moving the site away from its goal of focussing on professors.

####ASSU Anti-Calendar
#####Description:
Provides a list of pdfs containing information on course difficulty, the pdfs were last posted in 2012 and not
all courses were included. The information is based off of the end of the year course surveys conducted at u of t.
The pdfs display courses taken in their respective faculties, and each course has ratings for each instructor who
taught it. Courses are rated by workload, difficulty, and learning experience. Ratings for the professor’s ability
to present, explain, communicate, and teach are also included. A mean rating corresponds with each rating, as well
as a the percentage of survey participants that would take the course again.

#####How our product differs:
Our product offers intractability for users, as well as the ability to search by course, and significantly superior
design and usability. As it stands now, the anti-calendar can only be influenced by users in the form of end of
year surveys, whereas we offer the ability for users to enter the site and input their own feedback for others
to view. Our site will also look much better and have it’s data displayed in ways more visually appealing that
pdfs. Additionally, our product will have a dedicated search function, something the anti-calendar does not offer.

#####Difference in users/scenarios:
Our product would be much better for students looking to search for a specific course or rate a course
themselves. The reason the ASSU doesn’t offer the ability to search by course is coupled with the fact they 
store their data in pdfs, which can be difficult to parse. Also, the reason they don’t allow users to rate a 
course is because they already have access to data from the U of T course surveys.

#####What it would take to accommodate those users/scenarios:
In order for the ASSU to allow users to do those things, they would need to make significant changes to
their anti-calendar system. First, they would need to store the course data in some sort of data-structure
apart from pdfs to allow it to be easily searched, and then implement the search functionality. It would also
need to provide a way to allow for students to provide input on their courses, this would require the way
they present their data to be dynamic - hence not pdfs. In total this would be too big of an endeavour for
the ASSU to undertake, especially considering the anti-calendar hasn’t been updated for 3 years.

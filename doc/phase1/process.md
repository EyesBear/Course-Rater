###Process

**How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**

In the early stage, when we formed our group, our primary source of communcation was through email. After the first meeting, we decided to use an android application, called slack, to communicate with each other. Slack was effective at organizing our plans and ideas as multiple disucussion channels can be opened (general, phase1, brainstorm ideas, etc). We were able to keep each other updated on our progress. We also use google docs to collaborate on writing. 

**How did you make decisions?**

We make decisions by discussing first to see if the idea is comfortable for everyone. If the majority of us agree on a decision then that idea will be accepted, other a new idea would be proposed. On the other hand if someone is more experianced and is certain that their idea is best then we would also accept it. Overall, descions are done through voting and each of us would pitch an idea and choose from the best one.

**Did you meet in person or online? How frequently did you meet?**

The majority of the team prefer to meet in person. In the first meeting, we have decided that we will meet once a week; that is Friday 6pm at BA3200. The reason of why we meet only once a week is because we have 7 members, and it is hard to find a time that fits everyoneâ€™s timetable. However, this is subject to change when moving forward into the project where we most likely would need to meet up more frequenetly. Smaller group meetings for more specific discussions can be held for those that can come.

**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**

We should start early in next phase. For the first phase, the group meeting was 3 days before the deadline since everyone has different midterms and we could not come up with a day that we were all free. We should communicate with each other more frequently and collaborate on the project together without leaving anyone out.

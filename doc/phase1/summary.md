###Summary

**The Project Objective**:

Design a website that allows students to submit a review and rate the courses that they have taken at UofT. This website will display general information about the course including course ratings, professor ratings, student reviews and comments.The ratings would be user driven and will be constantly changing as each student review is submitted. The goal of the website is to allow students to get a better understanding of the course whether it helping students deciding between courses or a general guide to help student find a course to suite their needs. 

**The Key Personas**:

There are two main personas here, students that have just completed the course and students that are searching for a course.

**Key Persona 1**: Student who has just finished a course
	
These students need a way to express their opinions on the course they have just completed whether it be good or bad. Leaving a positive rating and review can help attract more students to take this course. While critical reviews can act as a caution for students that are interested and have a better understanding of what the course will be like.

**Key Persona 2**: Student looking for a course with certain criteria

Many students must take courses that are outside of their program requirements in order to fulfill the credits they need. Students who choose based off of their interests and short courses descriptions or recommendations from a few friends may find themselves in trouble as the course is not what they have expected. Students may also need to find a course that is relatively easy to balance out their schedule or they might want a course that is challenging but is also rewarding.

**The Key Scenarios**:

**Key Scenario 1**:

Student A has finished CSC301 with professor B and really enjoyed it so he wants to share his excitement about the course. Student A would recommend taking CSC301 with professor B instead of any of the other professors teaching it, as professor B was a good lecturer. Student A also wants to warn others that even though it is a fun course to take there is a lot of work involved. Student A can easily go to the website, type in the course name and choose the correct corresponding year to being rating the course. He may also read other student comments and see if any other students share the same feelings about the course, as well as, leaving his own review/comment.

**Key Scenario 2**:
	
Student B is choosing her courses for the fall/winter semesters and wants to make sure she does not put all the difficult courses in one semester. Student B would also like to take CSC108 as an elective but she does not know whether the workload is extremely high or not and none of her friends have taken that course before. Student B can easily do quick searches on each of her courses to see the average ratings for that course allowing her to minimize a hectic timetable. Student B can also nagivate to the CSC108 commenting/review section and see what other students have said about the course. She can sort the reviews but most recent or most upvotes .


**The Key Principles**:

**Key Principle**: Clear and descriptive reviews/ratings. 

  + multiple rating categories 
  + short user description of the course
  + ratings should be easy to understand

**Key Principle**: Easy to search for desired course
  + Users should be able to find courses very quickly and easily (simple navigation)
  + have special tabs/pages that show case certain courses (i.e easy courses, great learning experiance, highest rated, most popular, etc.)
